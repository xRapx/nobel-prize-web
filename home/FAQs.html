                            medicine, literature and peace. His will stated that the prizes should be awarded to “those
                            who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”

                            The word “laureate” refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In ancient Greece,
                            laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour. Put that together with the Nobel
                            Prize and we get “Nobel Prize laureate”.

                            A Nobel Prize can be shared by up to three individuals, or in the case of the peace prize,
                            it can also be awarded to an organisation. The rule that a prize can only be awarded to
                            three people comes from the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, which is responsible for
                            fulfilling the intentions of Nobel’s will. It specifically states: “In no case may a prize
                            amount be divided between more than three persons.”

                            No, a Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously. However, since 1974, if the recipient dies
                            after the prize has been announced they can still be awarded it. Previously, a person could
                            be awarded a prize posthumously if they had already been nominated before 1 February of the
                            same year, which was true of Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Nobel Prize in Literature 1931) and Dag
                            Hammarskjöld (Nobel Peace Prize, 1961). Following the 2011 announcement of the Nobel Prize
                            in Physiology or Medicine, it was discovered that one of the medicine laureates, Ralph
                            Steinman, had passed away three days earlier. The Board of the Nobel Foundation examined
                            the statutes, and came to the conclusion that Ralph Steinman should continue to remain a
                            Nobel Prize laureate, as the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet had announced the 2011
                            Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine without knowing of his death.
